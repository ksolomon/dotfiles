# dotfiles

My personal collection of dotfiles for Linux and Mac machines.

`.bashrc`/`.zshrc` will use extra files (`dircolors`, `aliases`, `.oh-my-zsh`) from the repo.  You won't generally need to edit these files.

You can add machine-specific aliases to `~/.local_aliases` and `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` will pick these up.
